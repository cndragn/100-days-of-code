# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 12 July 2017

**Tasks**:<br>
CS50 Pset 3<br>
FCC Intermedite Algorithms 

**Notes:** CS50 - Realized I still had to "make file" for my changes to helper.c to work. Well duh!  No wonder... Got bubble sort and linear search working. Working on binary search... FCC - Romeo is giving me troubles...

### Day 1: 11 July 2017

**Tasks**: <br>
FCC Intermedite Algorithms<br>
CS50 Pset 3/Find

**Notes:** FCC - I split the number into ones, tens, etc. and put my roman numbers in a literal object array. It worked but my code was crazy huge so I looked up a hint and realized where I was doing more work than I had to.  I wasn't totally wrong at least...only mostly. Ahh! / CS50 - I am so lost...I ended up deleting everything to start over.

### Day 0: 10 July 2017

**Tasks**: Worked on FCC Intermedite Algorithms

**Notes:** I recently cleared the cache on my browser, which reset all my code on FCC.  I only just started Adv. Algorithms and the second had been saved, so I just went ahead and redid the first one.  Took me almost an hour, but thats still way less than the first time I solved it.
