# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 12: 22 July 2017

**Notes:** 
So, I was feeling confident and decided to sumbit my application to LaunchCode and take the coding test.  I spent about 10m on the first question then decided to come back to it later. I got the next one correct pretty quickly, but then the last one got me good.  I knew straightaway how I was going to solve it except that if finally dawned on me how wrong I was and had to start over.  I think I got on the right track, but ran out of time. So annoyed with myself for waasting time with the wrong approach and so embarrassed someone will see that code that I wanna dig a hole and crawl into it...except I live on the third floor and my downstairs neighbors wouldnt appreciate me dropping in like that.

### Day 10: 20 July 2017

**Notes:** 
Today I had a really interesting convo with somoene on FCC about the importance of shoving away those pesky little voices that feed on imposters syndrome...  I really wish I had been able to recognize it and had more faith in my abilities to start expanding my knowledge years ago.  Now that I am doing it, I am feeling pretty on top of the world...  As frustrating as the process is, it feels awsome. This has been a rough year so far, but nevermind the bad stuff, I'll always remember this as the year I finally took that step towards the career I have always wanted, and that makes this a good year indeed.

### Day 5: 15 July 2017

**Notes:** I worked on my calculator all day today.. over 7 hours.  I made a ton of leeway and its almost done, but Ive spent the past 2 or hours saying "Just this one last thing then it's working perfectly!" But so far each one last thing leads to another one last thing...

### Day 4: 14 July 2017

**Notes:** Decided to hunker down and get serious about making progress...  focusing on dedicating more time to study and coding.

### Day 3: 13 July 2017

**Notes:** CS50 - Finally finished Pset3/Find.. HackerRank - I found there were too many issues and errors in the 7 Days of JS challenges and it was getting beyond painful to solve them..no wonder it has been archived by HR! So now Im doing the 30 Days of Code! FCC - Got my calculator project started and excited about it!

### Day 2: 12 July 2017

**Notes:** CS50 - Realized I still had to "make file" for my changes to helper.c to work. Well duh!  No wonder... Got bubble sort and linear search working. Working on binary search... FCC - Romeo is giving me troubles...

### Day 1: 11 July 2017

**Notes:** FCC - I split the number into ones, tens, etc. and put my roman numbers in a literal object array. It worked but my code was crazy huge so I looked up a hint and realized where I was doing more work than I had to.  I wasn't totally wrong at least...only mostly. Ahh! / CS50 - I am so lost...I ended up deleting everything to start over.

### Day 0: 10 July 2017

**Notes:** I recently cleared the cache on my browser, which reset all my code on FCC.  I only just started Adv. Algorithms and the second had been saved, so I just went ahead and redid the first one.  Took me almost an hour, but thats still way less than the first time I solved it.
