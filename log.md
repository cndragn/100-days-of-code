# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10 July 2017

**Tasks**: Worked on FCC Intermedite Algorithms

**Notes:** I recently cleared the cache on my browser, which reset all my code on FCC.  I only just started Adv. Algorithms and the second had been saved, so I just went ahead and redid the first one.  Took me almost an hour, but thats still way less than the first time I solved it.

**View Progress:** [FCC Algorithm: Solve All Numbers](https://github.com/cndragn/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/1-sum-all-numbers.js)
