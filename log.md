# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: 16 July 2017

**Notes:** 

**Progress:** <br>
[CS50 Pset3 / Game of Fifteen](https://github.com/cndragn/CS50x/tree/master/pset3/fifteen) :100: <br>

### Day 5: 15 July 2017

**Notes:** I worked on my calculator all day today.. over 7 hours.  I made a ton of leeway and its almost done, but Ive spent the past 2 or hours saying "Just this one last thing then it's working perfectly!" But so far each one last thing leads to another one last thing... 

**Progress:** [FCC Javascript Calculator](https://github.com/cndragn/javascript-calculator) :warning:

### Day 4: 14 July 2017

**Notes:** Decided to hunker down and get serious about making progress...  focusing on dedicating more time to study and coding.

### Day 3: 13 July 2017

**Notes:** CS50 - Finally finished Pset3/Find.. HackerRank - I found there were too many issues and errors in the 7 Days of JS challenges and it was getting beyond painful to solve them..no wonder it has been archived by HR! So now Im doing the 30 Days of Code! FCC - Got my calculator project started and excited about it!

### Day 2: 12 July 2017

**Notes:** CS50 - Realized I still had to "make file" for my changes to helper.c to work. Well duh!  No wonder... Got bubble sort and linear search working. Working on binary search... FCC - Romeo is giving me troubles...

**Progress:** <br>

### Day 1: 11 July 2017

**Notes:** FCC - I split the number into ones, tens, etc. and put my roman numbers in a literal object array. It worked but my code was crazy huge so I looked up a hint and realized where I was doing more work than I had to.  I wasn't totally wrong at least...only mostly. Ahh! / CS50 - I am so lost...I ended up deleting everything to start over.

### Day 0: 10 July 2017

**Notes:** I recently cleared the cache on my browser, which reset all my code on FCC.  I only just started Adv. Algorithms and the second had been saved, so I just went ahead and redid the first one.  Took me almost an hour, but thats still way less than the first time I solved it.

**Progress:** [FCC Algorithm: Solve All Numbers](https://github.com/cndragn/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/1-sum-all-numbers.js) :100:
